# Problem Formulation 1: Convergence Analysis of Distributed Gradient Descent with Heterogeneous Agent Dynamics in Synthetic Financial Markets
---

## Research Problem Statement

Develop an empirical framework for analyzing the convergence properties of distributed gradient descent algorithms when training N agents on synthetic limit order book data, where each agent represents a different geographical market (America, Asia, Europe) with the same data generating function but potentially different local dynamics due to market microstructure variations.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Convergence Metrics for Heterogeneous Agents**: How can we define and measure convergence rates when local agents experience different gradient dynamics due to varying market conditions while sharing the same underlying data generating process?

2. **Global-Local Gradient Interaction**: What is the theoretical relationship between local agent convergence and global model performance when agents operate on temporally correlated but geographically distinct market data?

3. **Stability Under Agent Heterogeneity**: Under what conditions does the distributed system maintain convergence guarantees when individual agents exhibit different learning behaviors due to market-specific factors?

## Methodology Overview

1. **Theoretical Analysis**: Extend existing convergence bounds from [1](https://jmlr.org/papers/v20/19-543.html)[2](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume23/20-899/20-899.pdf) to account for the specific structure of financial time series data and multi-market scenarios.
    
2. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Utilize the approach from Cao et al. for building synthetic LOB datasets with controlled distributional shifts [6](https://openreview.net/forum?id=_u-1--wBV1) to create realistic market scenarios.
    
3. **Convergence Metrics**: Develop novel metrics inspired by the work on federated learning convergence [3](https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/how-is-model-convergence-measured-in-federated-learning) adapted for financial forecasting accuracy and local agent stability.

## Expected Contributions: 

- Empirical characterization of how market heterogeneity affects distributed learning stability
- Practical convergence monitoring metrics for real-time distributed trading systems

This research aims to establish how specific distributional characteristics of market data causally impact the learning dynamics and forecasting performance of distributed trading agents

## Key Research Questions

# Problem Formulation 3: Real-Time Online Learning with Memory and Computational Time Constraints in Heterogeneous Multi-Market Distributed Systems
---

## Research Problem Statement

Develop an online learning framework for distributed gradient descent that explicitly accounts for memory, computational time constraints and communication delays due to blockchain computation dynamics, specifically when training agents across different cloud computing regions, and with heterogeneous data generation parameters. This research addresses the critical challenge of maintaining learning performance under realistic memory, computational and temporal constraints in high-frequency trading environments that are executed on the Blockchain.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Time-Constrained Convergence**: How do memory and computational time limits affect convergence guarantees in distributed online learning when agents must make predictions within millisecond windows while being computed OnChain ?
    
2. **Heterogeneous Parameter Adaptation**: What adaptive strategies can maintain learning performance when agents learn using synthetic data generating function but different parameter values due to market-specific characteristics ?
    
3. **Communication-Computation Tradeoffs**: How should the system balance local computation time versus communication frequency to optimize overall forecasting performance under strict timing constraints?

## Literature Foundation

The theoretical foundation is built on recent advances in online learning with heterogeneous data. Gadginmath et al. introduce the Switched Online Learning Algorithm (SOLA) for heterogeneous online learning with bounded regret guarantees [12](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05432). This work directly addresses scenarios where agents accumulate disparate data and use different local algorithms.

For time-constrained distributed optimization, the work by Malandrino and Chiasserini examines convergence bounds in real-world distributed learning, specifically addressing how bounds can predict performance in federated learning tasks [13](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.02155.pdf). The framework by Du et al. provides novel non-linear aggregation functions for efficient distributed machine learning over time-varying networks [14](https://openreview.net/forum?id=25WODOWVvR).

The challenge of online learning in financial contexts is addressed by recent work on high-frequency trading with machine learning [15](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01062)[16](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16160), which demonstrates practical approaches to real-time financial prediction under computational constraints.

## Methodology Overview

1. **Online Algorithm Design**: Extend the SOLA framework [12](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05432) to handle the specific requirements of financial time series prediction with timing constraints.
    
2. **Adaptive Parameter Management**: Develop strategies based on [14](https://openreview.net/forum?id=25WODOWVvR) for dynamic adaptation to heterogeneous market parameters while maintaining convergence properties.
    
3. **Real-Time Implementation**: Create a simulation framework using high-frequency trading data characteristics from [15](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01062)[16](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16160) to validate performance under realistic timing constraints.
